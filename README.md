# Dataset for Deep Learning Based Storm Surge Prediction
We provide the dataset used in this study for deep learning-based storm surge prediction, including 155 observed typhoon tracks (1979â€“2024) from the China Meteorological Administration and 2,184 synthetic typhoon tracks generated using the Environment-Dependent Probabilistic Tropical Cyclone (EPTC) model.
